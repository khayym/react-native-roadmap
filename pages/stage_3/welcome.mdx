- **What is programming language | Hello, World**

  A programming language is a set of rules that computer programmers use to write programs that can be executed by a computer. Programming languages allow us to create software, websites, and apps that are used every day. In this section, we'll explore what programming languages are and how they work.
  Hello, World!
  "Hello, World!" is a classic example used when learning to program in a new language. It is a simple program that prints the text "Hello, World!" to the screen. Here's an example of the "Hello, World!" program written in Python:

  ```jsx
  console.log('Hello, World!');
  ```

  This program tells the computer to print the text "Hello, World!" to the screen. It's a simple program, but it's a great starting point for learning a new programming language.
