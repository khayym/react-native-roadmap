In JavaScript, numbers can be written with or without decimals. For example, **`42`** and **`3.14`** are both valid numbers in JavaScript. Numbers in JavaScript are stored as 64-bit floating-point numbers, which means they have limited precision.

Here are some basic arithmetic operations you can perform with numbers in JavaScript:

- Addition: **`x + y`**
- Subtraction: **`x - y`**
- Multiplication: **`x * y`**
- Division: **`x / y`**
- Modulus (remainder after division): **`x % y`**

Here's an example of how to use these operators:

```jsx
let x = 10;
let y = 5;

console.log(x + y); // 15
console.log(x - y); // 5
console.log(x * y); // 50
console.log(x / y); // 2
console.log(x % y); // 0
```

In addition to basic arithmetic, JavaScript provides a number of built-in methods for working with numbers. Here are a few examples:

- **`toFixed`**: Rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places and returns a string.

```jsx
let x = 3.14159265359;
console.log(x.toFixed(2)); // "3.14"
```

- **`isNaN`**: Returns true if a value is not a number.

```jsx
console.log(isNaN(42)); // false
console.log(isNaN('Hello')); // true
```

- **`parseInt`**/**`parseFloat`**: Converts a string to a number.

```jsx
console.log(parseInt('42')); // 42
console.log(parseFloat('3.14')); // 3.14
```

- **`Math.max`**/**`Math.min`**: Returns the highest or lowest value in a list of numbers.

```jsx
console.log(Math.max(10, 20, 30)); // 30
console.log(Math.min(10, 20, 30)); // 10
```

- **`Math.random`**: Generates a random number between 0 and 1.

```jsx
console.log(Math.random()); // 0.123456789...
```

These are just a few examples of the many methods available for working with numbers in JavaScript. By using them, you can perform complex mathematical operations and manipulate numbers in a variety of ways.
