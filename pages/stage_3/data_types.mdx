- **Data Types**

  JavaScript has several built-in data types that are used to represent different kinds of values. Understanding these data types is important when working with JavaScript code.
  Primitive Data Types:
  JavaScript has six primitive data types:

  1. Number: Used to represent numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.
  2. String: Used to represent text values.
  3. Boolean: Used to represent true/false values.
  4. Undefined: Used to represent a variable that has not been assigned a value.
  5. Null: Used to represent a variable that has been explicitly set to a null value.
  6. Symbol: Used to represent a unique identifier.
     Complex Data Types:
     JavaScript also has two complex data types:
  7. Object: Used to represent collections of key/value pairs.
  8. Function: Used to represent a block of code that can be executed.

  - `String`: A sequence of characters, such as **`"Hello World"`**. Strings can be enclosed in either single or double quotes.
  - `Number`: Numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers. For example, **`10`** and **`3.14`**.
  - `Boolean`: Represents a true/false value. The values **`true`** and **`false`** are the only possible values for a Boolean.
  - `Null`: Represents a non-existent value. The value **`null`** represents a deliberate non-value.
  - `Undefined`: Represents a value that has not been assigned. The value **`undefined`** represents a value that has not been assigned or a declared variable that has not been assigned a value.
  - `Object`: A collection of properties and methods. Objects can be created using object literals or with the **`Object`** constructor.
  - `Array`: An ordered list of values. Arrays are objects and can contain elements of any data type.
  - `Symbol` :A unique and immutable data type that can be used as an identifier for object properties.
  - The **`typeof`** operator in JavaScript is used to determine the data type of a value. It returns a string that represents the data type of the operand. The syntax for using **`typeof`** is:

    ```jsx
    typeof operand;
    ```

    For example:

    ```jsx
    let name = 'John Doe';
    console.log(typeof name); // "string"

    let age = 30;
    console.log(typeof age); // "number"

    let isMarried = true;
    console.log(typeof isMarried); // "boolean"

    let car = null;
    console.log(typeof car); // "object"

    let job;
    console.log(typeof job); // "undefined"
    ```

  - It's important to note that in JavaScript, **`typeof null`** returns "object". This is considered a bug in the language and is a well-known issue.
  - The **`typeof`** operator can be useful for debugging and for checking the data type of a value before performing operations on it. It can also be used to determine if a variable has been declared and assigned a value, by checking if the result of **`typeof`** is "undefined".
