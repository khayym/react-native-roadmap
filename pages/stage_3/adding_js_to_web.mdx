- **Adding JavaScript to a Web Page**

  JavaScript is a powerful language that allows you to add interactivity to your web pages. To use JavaScript in a web page, you need to include it in your HTML code.
  There are two ways to add JavaScript to a web page:

  1. Inline JavaScript: You can add JavaScript code directly to an HTML element by using the **`onclick`** attribute. For example:

  ```jsx
  <button onclick="alert('Hello, World!')">Click me!</button>
  ```

  This code creates a button that, when clicked, will display an alert with the text "Hello, World!".
  While this method is simple, it's generally not recommended because it can make your HTML code difficult to read and maintain.

  2. External JavaScript: The preferred method for adding JavaScript to a web page is to put the code in a separate file with a **`.js`** extension and then link to it in your HTML code using the **`script`** tag. For example:

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>My Web Page</title>
      <script src="myscript.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <p>My web page content goes here.</p>
    </body>
  </html>
  ```

  In this example, we've created a file called **`myscript.js`** and linked to it in the head of our HTML code using the **`script`** tag. The JavaScript code in **`myscript.js`** will execute when the web page is loaded.
  Here are some best practices for adding JavaScript to a web page:

  1. Put your JavaScript code in a separate file: This makes your HTML code easier to read and maintain.
  2. Use descriptive variable names: This makes your code easier to understand and maintain.
  3. Comment your code: Comments can help you remember what your code does and make it easier for others to understand.
  4. Use semicolons: While JavaScript doesn't require you to use semicolons at the end of each line of code, it's considered best practice to do so.
