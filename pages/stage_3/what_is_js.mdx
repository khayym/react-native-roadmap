- **What is JavaScript**

  JavaScript is a programming language that is primarily used to add interactivity to web pages. It was first created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation.
  JavaScript is a high-level programming language, which means that it is designed to be easy for humans to read and write. It is also a dynamic language, which means that variables are not assigned a specific data type at the time they are created. This makes JavaScript a very flexible and versatile language.
  JavaScript is used to create interactive web pages, which can respond to user input, validate form data, and provide visual effects. It is also used to build web applications, which are programs that run entirely within a web browser.
  JavaScript Examples:
  Here are some examples of what JavaScript can do:

  1. Validate form data: JavaScript can be used to ensure that the data entered into a form by a user is valid. For example, it can check that an email address has the correct format or that a phone number has the correct number of digits.
  2. Create visual effects: JavaScript can be used to create visual effects on a web page, such as changing the color of text or images when a user hovers over them.
  3. Build web applications: JavaScript can be used to build complex web applications, such as online games or social networking sites.
