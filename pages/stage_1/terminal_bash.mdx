- **Introduction to Basic Terminal/Bash Commands**

  If you're new to programming or system administration, you might be intimidated by the command line interface (CLI) and the terminal or bash shell. However, learning a few basic commands can help you navigate and control your computer more efficiently and effectively. In this tutorial, we'll introduce you to some of the most essential terminal/bash commands and show you how to use them with examples.
  Here are some of the most basic commands you'll need to know:

  - **`pwd`**: Prints the current working directory (folder). For example, **`pwd`** displays the path of the current directory, such as **`/Users/John/Documents`**.
  - **`ls`**: Lists the contents of the current directory (folder). For example, **`ls /Users/John/Desktop`** lists the files and folders on John's desktop.
  - **`cd`**: Changes the current directory to the specified directory. For example, **`cd /Users/John/Documents`** changes the current directory to John's Documents folder.
  - **`mkdir`**: Creates a new directory with the specified name. For example, **`mkdir my-folder`** creates a new folder named "my-folder" in the current directory.
  - **`touch`**: Creates a new empty file with the specified name. For example, **`touch my-file.txt`** creates a new file named "my-file.txt" in the current directory.
  - **`rm`**: Removes (deletes) the specified file or directory. For example, **`rm my-file.txt`** deletes the file "my-file.txt" in the current directory. To delete a directory and its contents, use the **`r`** (recursive) option, like this: **`rm -r my-folder`**.

    These are just a few of the most basic commands you'll need to know. As you become more comfortable with the terminal/bash shell, you'll learn many more commands and options that can help you work more efficiently and automate tasks.
