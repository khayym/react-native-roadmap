    Closures are one of the most powerful features of JavaScript. JavaScript allows for the nesting of functions and grants the inner function full access to all the variables and functions defined inside the outer function (and all other variables and functions that the outer function has access to).

    However, the outer function does *not* have access to the variables and functions defined inside the inner function. This provides a sort of encapsulation for the variables of the inner function.

    Also, since the inner function has access to the scope of the outer function, the variables and functions defined in the outer function will live longer than the duration of the outer function execution, if the inner function manages to survive beyond the life of the outer function. A closure is created when the inner function is somehow made available to any scope outside the outer function.

    ```jsx
    // The outer function defines a variable called "name"
    const pet = function (name) {
    const getName = function () {
    // The inner function has access to the "name" variable of the outer function
    return name;
    };
    return getName; // Return the inner function, thereby exposing it to outer scopes
    };
    const myPet = pet("Vivie");

    myPet(); // Returns "Vivie"
    ```

    It can be much more complex than the code above. An object containing methods for manipulating the inner variables of the outer function can be returned.

    ```jsx
    const createPet = function (name) {
    let sex;

    const pet = {
    // setName(newName) is equivalent to setName: function (newName)
    // in this context
    setName(newName) {
    name = newName;
    },

    getName() {
      return name;
    },

    getSex() {
      return sex;
    },

    setSex(newSex) {
      if (
        typeof newSex === "string" &&
        (newSex.toLowerCase() === "male" || newSex.toLowerCase() === "female")
      ) {
        sex = newSex;
      }
    },
    };
    return pet;
    };

    const pet = createPet("Vivie");
    pet.getName(); // Vivie

    pet.setName("Oliver");
    pet.setSex("male");
    pet.getSex(); // male
    pet.getName(); // Oliver
    ```
