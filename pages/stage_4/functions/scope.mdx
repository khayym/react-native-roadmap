    Variables defined inside a function are local to that function and cannot be accessed from outside it.
    However, a function can access all variables and functions defined in the scope in which it is defined.

    In other words, a global function can access all global variables. A function defined inside another function can also access all variables of its parent function, as well as any other variables accessible to the parent function.

    In short, a function's scope determines which variables it can access. A local function can only access local variables, while a global function can access all global variables.

    ```jsx
    // The following variables are defined in the global scope
    const num1 = 20;
    const num2 = 3;
    const name = "Chamakh";

    // This function is defined in the global scope
    function multiply() {
    return num1 * num2;
    }

    multiply(); // Returns 60
    ```

    ```jsx
    // A nested function example
    function getScore() {
    const num1 = 2;
    const num2 = 3;

    function add() {
    return ${name} scored ${num1 + num2};
    }

    return add();
    }

    getScore(); // Returns "Chamakh scored 5"
    ```
