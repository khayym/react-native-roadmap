The logical operators (**`&&`**, **`||`**, and **`!`**) can be used in combination with the **`if-else`** statement to create more complex conditions and control the flow of execution in a program.
Here's an example of using the **`&&`** operator to evaluate multiple conditions in an **`if-else`** statement:

```jsx
let score = 75;
let grade;

if (score >= 90 && score <= 100) {
  grade = 'A';
} else if (score >= 80 && score < 90) {
  grade = 'B';
} else if (score >= 70 && score < 80) {
  grade = 'C';
} else {
  grade = 'F';
}

console.log('Your grade is ' + grade);
```

In this example, the **`&&`** operator is used to evaluate two conditions for each of the **`if`** statements. If both conditions are true, then the corresponding code block will be executed and the value of **`grade`** will be assigned. In this case, since **`score`** is equal to 75, the conditions for **`A`** and **`B`** are not met, and the condition for **`C`** is met, so the value of **`grade`** is assigned to "C".
Here's an example of using the **`||`** operator:

```jsx
let age = 15;
let canDrive;

if (age >= 16 || age >= 18) {
  canDrive = true;
} else {
  canDrive = false;
}

console.log('Can you drive? ' + canDrive);
```

In this example, the **`||`** operator is used to evaluate two conditions in the **`if`** statement. If either condition is true, then the code block will be executed and the value of **`canDrive`** will be assigned to **`true`**. In this case, since **`age`** is equal to 15, neither condition is met, so the value of **`canDrive`** is assigned to **`false`**.
The **`!`** operator can be used to negate a condition and reverse its value. For example:

```jsx
let isSunny = false;
let bringUmbrella;

if (!isSunny) {
  bringUmbrella = true;
} else {
  bringUmbrella = false;
}

console.log('Bring an umbrella? ' + bringUmbrella);
```

In this example, the **`!`** operator is used to negate the value of **`isSunny`**, which is **`false`**. The result is that the condition in the **`if`** statement is true, and the value of **`bringUmbrella`** is assigned to **`true`**.
