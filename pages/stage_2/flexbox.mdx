- **Using Flexbox**

  Flexbox is a layout system in CSS that makes it easier to create flexible and responsive layouts in web design. With Flexbox, you can align and distribute content in a flexible and dynamic way, making it ideal for building complex user interfaces. In this section, we'll introduce the basics of using Flexbox in web design.
  Here are some of the key concepts of Flexbox:

  1. Flex Container: A flex container is an HTML element that contains one or more flex items. You can create a flex container by setting the display property of an element to "flex".
  2. Flex Items: Flex items are the child elements of a flex container. You can use Flexbox properties to control the alignment, spacing, and size of flex items.
  3. Main Axis and Cross Axis: Flexbox has two axes: the main axis and the cross axis. The main axis runs in the direction of the flex container, while the cross axis runs perpendicular to the main axis.
  4. Flex Direction: The flex direction property specifies the direction of the main axis. The default value is "row", which means that the main axis runs horizontally. You can also set the value to "column" to make the main axis run vertically.
  5. Justify Content: The justify-content property controls the alignment of flex items along the main axis. You can use this property to distribute flex items evenly or align them to the start, center, or end of the flex container.
  6. Align Items: The align-items property controls the alignment of flex items along the cross axis. You can use this property to align flex items to the top, center, or bottom of the flex container.
  7. Flex Wrap: The flex-wrap property controls whether flex items are forced onto a single line or can be wrapped onto multiple lines.
     Here is an example of how to use Flexbox to create a simple layout:

  ```html
  <div class="container">
    <div class="item">Item 1</div>
    <div class="item">Item 2</div>
    <div class="item">Item 3</div>
  </div>

  .container { display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items:
  center; } .item { flex: 1; margin: 10px; padding: 10px; background-color:
  #eee; }
  ```

  This code creates a flex container with three flex items. The justify-content property is set to "space-between" to distribute the items evenly along the main axis, while the align-items property is set to "center" to align them to the center of the cross axis. The flex property of the items is set to 1 to make them fill the available space, and margins and padding are added for spacing.
  Overall, Flexbox is a powerful tool for creating flexible and responsive layouts in web design. By mastering the basics of Flexbox, you can create complex and dynamic user interfaces that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
