    `try` — test a block of code for errors.

    `catch` — handle the error.

    `throw` — create custom errors.

    `finally` — execute code, after try and catch, regardless of the result.

    ## **The “try…catch” syntax**

    The try…catch construct has two main blocks:

    ```jsx
    try {// code} catch (err) {// handling error}
    ```

    ## **The “try…catch” flow-chart**

    ![https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:650/1*W75sKV_KAlC2LKPMa0xKcg.png](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:650/1*W75sKV_KAlC2LKPMa0xKcg.png)

    **Let’s see some example**

    No error example:

    ```jsx
    try {
    console.log('Start');
    // ...no errors
    console.log('End');
    } catch (err) {
    console.log('Catch is ignored, because there are no errors');
    }
    ```

    In this code, there is no error that’s why the *catch* is ignored.

    With error example:

    ```jsx
    try {
    console.log('Start of try runs');
    blablabla; // error, variable is not defined!
    console.log('End(no reached)');
    } catch (err) {
    console.log(`Error has occurred!`,err);
    }
    ```

    ## **`try...catch` only works for runtime errors**

    For try…catch to work, the code must be runnable. In other words, it should be valid JavaScript.

    ```jsx
    try {
      <<<<<<<<<
    } catch (err) {
      alert("Can't understand this code, it's invalid");
    }
    ```

    So, try…catch can only handle errors that occur in a valid code. Such errors are called “runtime errors” or, sometimes, “exceptions”.

    ## **try…catch works synchronously**

    If an exception happens in the “scheduled” code, then try…catch won’t catch it:

    ```jsx
    try {
      setTimeout(function() {
        noSuchVariable; // script will stop/die here
      }, 1000);
    } catch (err) {
      alert( "won't work" );
    }
    ```

    To catch an exception inside a scheduled function, try…catch must be inside that function:

    ```jsx
    setTimeout(function() {
      try {
        noSuchVariable; // try...catch handles the error!
      } catch {
        alert( "error is caught here!" );
      }
    }, 1000);
    ```

    **The Error Object**

    JavaScript has a built-in error object that provides error information when an error occurs.

    The error object provides two useful properties: name and message.

    name - Sets or returns an error name

    message - Sets or returns an error message (a string)

    ## **try…catch…finally**

    The try…catch construct may have one more code clause: finally.

    The extended syntax looks like this:

    ```jsx
    try {
       ... try to execute
    } catch (err) {
       ... handle errors
    } finally {
       ... execute always
    }
    ```

    Try running this code:

    ```jsx
    try {
      alert( 'try' );
      if (confirm('Make an error?')) BAD_CODE();
    } catch (err) {
      alert( 'catch' );
    } finally {
      alert( 'finally' );
    }
    ```

    The code has two ways of execution:

    If you answer “Yes” to “Make an error?”, then try → catch → finally.If you say “No”, then try → finally.
