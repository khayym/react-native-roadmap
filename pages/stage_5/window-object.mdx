    In every environment of JavaScript, there is a **Global object**. And the variables that are created inside this global object, represent the real properties of that particular object. The functions inside the global object represent the methods of the global object. Inside the browser environment, the global object is known as the **window object**, which represents the browser window. This browser window contains a web page. This is known as a window object in JavaScript.

    The window object comes to the top position in the list of objects of the **DOM(Document Object Model)** hierarchy. The window object in JavaScript will display the contents of any webpage like all the HTML tags, data, links, images, etc.

    Whenever we surf a browser and a webpage appears on the screen, it displays the contents of the document on the window screen, where the creation of the window object takes place.

    **Note** there is any frame or iframe in the Html document, the browser will create an extra window object for each of these frames or iframe.

    ## The Browser Object Model

    The **Browser Object Model (BOM)** is a set of properties, rules, and methods in JavaScript that is used for containing all the information related to the browser and screen of a computer that we see at that instant of time. There is much information that we can fetch with the help of the **Window Object Model** in JavaScript Like,

    - We can find the browser name that we are using currently, we can find the dimension of that window screen, the page history like which page we were using before coming to the present page, etc. The Browser Object Model can be also used to create **pop-up windows**.

    Officially, there is **no certain set of rules** or standards for BOM (Browser Object Model) but there are some properties and methods that are so common and almost all the browsers support them. Whatever we see in a browser window like popup, frames, window tab, iframes, etc all have a particular window object.
